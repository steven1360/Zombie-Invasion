# Zombie Invasion

## Overview
Zombie Invasion is a 2D topdown survival and shooter game made with Unity and C#.

## How To Play
Your character holds 4 weapons: knife, pistol, rifle, shotgun. When the game starts, you will not have any ammo to use your firearms. Explore the map
to familiarize yourself with its layout, and collect supply boxes, which spawn randomly across the map, to replenish your ammo. Zombies spawn slowly at the beginning, so take your time stocking up on ammo. Your goal is to try and survive for as long as possible. Good luck!
